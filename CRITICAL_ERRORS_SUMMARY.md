# Critical Errors Summary

## üö® **MAIN ISSUE: CLIP Service Port Conflict**

**Error:**
```
ERROR: [Errno 48] error while attempting to bind on address ('127.0.0.1', 8765): address already in use
```

**What's happening:**
- The auto-start CLIP service is trying to start
- But port 8765 is already in use (by the manually started service)
- The service fails to start but the app continues

**Fix:**
Kill the manually running CLIP service before starting the app:

```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep similarity_service.py

# Kill it
kill <PID>

# Then restart the Electron app
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **SECONDARY ISSUES (Non-Critical)**

### 1. Old-style JPEG Compression Warnings

**Affected files:**
- `_GP_0217.CR2`
- `_GP_0222.CR2`
- `_GP_0783.CR2`
- `_GP_0788.CR2`
- `_GP_0811.CR2`
- `_GP_0826.CR2`
- `_GP_0830.CR2`
- `_GP_0936.CR2`
- `_GP_0941.CR2`
- `_GP_0946.CR2`
- `_GP_0950.CR2`

**Error:**
```
Sharp extraction failed, trying exiftool
Input file has corrupt header: Old-style JPEG compression support is not configured
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Not a problem!**
- Sharp fails on these old CR2 files
- System automatically falls back to exiftool
- All 13 images processed successfully
- This is expected behavior for older Canon RAW files

---

### 2. Missing Timestamps in Derivative TIF Files

**Affected files:**
- `A006_C002_0315PL_S000.0000002-Edit-2-Edit-Edit.tif`
- `A006_C002_0315PL_S000.0000002-Edit-2-Edit.tif`
- `A006_C002_0315PL_S000.0000002-Edit-2.tif`
- `A006_C002_0315PL_S000.0000002-Edit.tif`

**Warning:**
```
No timestamp found in EXIF
Skipping image without timestamp
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Expected behavior**
- These are edited derivative files
- Edited files often lose EXIF timestamp data
- The system correctly skips them (they're derivatives, not originals)
- The original TIF file has timestamps and is processed

---

### 3. CLIP Image Processor Warning

**Warning:**
```
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset
```

**Status:** ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Informational only**
- Just a deprecation warning from the transformers library
- Doesn't affect functionality
- Can be ignored

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT'S WORKING**

Despite the errors:
- ‚úÖ All 13 images processed successfully (100% success rate)
- ‚úÖ All images hashed
- ‚úÖ All results saved to database
- ‚úÖ Fallback to exiftool works perfectly for old CR2 files
- ‚úÖ 78 similarity comparisons completed (13 images = 78 pairs)

---

## üéØ **ACTION REQUIRED**

**To see the debug output Claude requested:**

1. **Kill the manually running CLIP service:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep similarity_service.py
   kill <PID>
   ```

2. **Restart your Electron app**
   - The auto-start service will now work
   - Check DevTools console for the debug output

3. **Process images again**
   - Look for `üîç ===== CLIP INPUT DEBUG =====` in console
   - Copy that output for Claude

**The debug code IS in place and ready - it just needs the port conflict resolved to work properly.**
