# 🚀 QUICK FIX - SUPER CLUSTER REPAIR

## 🎯 The Problem
My TIF thumbnail fix broke super clustering by using **different rotation logic** for TIF files vs RAW files.

**Result:** 78 files → 10 super clusters instead of 3

**Root Cause:** TIF files rotated differently → CLIP sees same scenes as different → fewer groupings

---

## ⚡ THE FIX (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Replace imageProcessor.js

```bash
# Backup current file
cp src/services/imageProcessor.js src/services/imageProcessor.js.backup

# Replace with fixed version
# Copy imageProcessor_SUPER_CLUSTER_FIX.js → src/services/imageProcessor.js
```

**What Changed:**
- Added `readOrientation()` - reads EXIF orientation explicitly
- Added `applyRotation()` - applies rotation conditionally
- Modified `processWithSharp()` - uses SAME rotation logic as RAW files

### Step 2: Clear Preview Cache

```bash
# macOS/Linux
rm -rf /tmp/vlm-tester-previews/*

# Or check your temp directory
# Find it in: Settings → System → Temp Directory
```

**Why:** Old previews have inconsistent rotations. Must regenerate all.

### Step 3: Test

```bash
npm start

# 1. Select your 78-file test directory
# 2. Process images
# 3. Go to Visual Analysis tab
# 4. Verify: Should see 3 super clusters (not 10)
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Thumbnails:** TIF files show thumbnails correctly
- [ ] **Grouping:** TIF+CR2 of same scene grouped together
- [ ] **Count:** 78 files → 3 super clusters ✅
- [ ] **Console:** No rotation errors, see "EXIF Orientation detected" messages
- [ ] **CLIP:** Similarity scores in high 80s-90s for matches

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Good Signs ✅
```
Console logs:
✅ "EXIF Orientation detected: { file: _GP_0831_adj.tif, orientation: 6 }"
✅ "Rotating 90° CW: { file: _GP_0831_adj.tif }"
✅ "Sharp processing successful"
✅ "CLIP similar representatives found: _GP_0831.CR2 ↔ _GP_0831_adj.tif (94%)"
```

### Bad Signs ❌
```
❌ "Failed to process with Sharp"
❌ Low CLIP scores (<80%) for same scene
❌ TIF files separated from their CR2 counterparts
❌ More than 3 super clusters
```

---

## 🔧 If Still Broken

1. **Check Sharp is installed:**
   ```bash
   npm list sharp
   # Should see sharp@0.33.x
   ```

2. **Verify exiftool is accessible:**
   ```bash
   which exiftool
   # Should return a path
   ```

3. **Check temp directory is writable:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /tmp/vlm-tester-previews/
   ```

4. **Look for errors in console:**
   - Open Developer Tools (Cmd+Option+I)
   - Check Console tab for errors
