   - International travel photography
   - Documents with multiple scripts
   - Cyrillic, Arabic, Asian languages

3. **Technical Photography**
   - Detailed equipment documentation
   - Scientific imagery
   - Engineering and architecture

4. **Quality-Critical Work**
   - Portfolio pieces
   - Client deliverables
   - Award submissions

### Best for Local Models:

## üîí Privacy Considerations

### What Gets Sent to Cloud:
- Image data (base64 encoded)
- Your prompt text
- Model parameters (temperature, etc.)

### What Stays Local:
- Original RAW files
- Generated XMP files
- Database content
- User settings
- Authentication tokens

### Ollama's Guarantees:
- Images processed for inference only
- Not stored permanently
- Not used for model training
- Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)

### Recommendation:
- Use cloud for general photography
- Use local for sensitive content
- Review Ollama's privacy policy

## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: First Request Slow
**Symptom:** First cloud model request takes 60+ seconds  
**Cause:** Model loading on server  
**Workaround:** Subsequent requests much faster  
**Status:** Expected behavior

### Issue 2: Occasional Timeouts
**Symptom:** Request times out after 2-3 minutes  
**Cause:** High server demand  
**Workaround:** Wait a few minutes and retry  
**Status:** Rate limiting by Ollama

### Issue 3: Authentication Expires
**Symptom:** "Authentication required" error after weeks  
**Cause:** Security token expiration  
**Workaround:** Re-run `ollama run qwen3-vl:235b-cloud`  
**Status:** Rare, expected security behavior

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Hybrid Workflow (Recommended)

```
Step 1: Bulk process with Local 7B (fast)
   ‚Üì
Step 2: Flag images needing better quality
   ‚Üì
Step 3: Re-process flagged images with Cloud 235B
   ‚Üì
Step 4: Merge results
```

**Benefits:**
- 90% of images processed quickly
- 10% get premium quality
- Best of both worlds

### 2. Strategic Model Selection

**Use decision tree:**
```
Does image have:
  - Multiple languages? ‚Üí Cloud
  - Complex architecture? ‚Üí Cloud
  - Technical details? ‚Üí Cloud
  - Standard content? ‚Üí Local
  - Batch processing? ‚Üí Local
  - Time-critical? ‚Üí Local
```

### 3. Prompt Optimization

**For Cloud Model:**
```text
‚úÖ Good: "Analyze this architectural photograph. Identify the building style, 
         materials used, historical period, and notable features. Include any 
         visible text in its original language."

‚ùå Bad:  "Describe this" (too vague)
‚ùå Bad:  "As an expert photographer..." (system message - not recommended)
```

**Key Points:**
- Be specific about what you want
- Mention the use case
- Don't use system messages
- Let model leverage its strengths
