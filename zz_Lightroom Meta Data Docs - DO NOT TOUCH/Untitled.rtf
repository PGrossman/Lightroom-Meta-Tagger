\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 I am going to start a new Claude project and i need you to create a good instruction document and as many other support documents in MD format to support the project. This will be a cursor project in that Cursor will be setting up the environment and writing all the code files. Claude will be the advisor and code reviewer and provide code where necessary to help cursor trouble shoot things. This will be an Electron based application running on my M4 Pro Mac Mini with 64G of memory . The app is going to be designed to get all the meta data and tags for photos in my Lightroom library and produce XMP side car files for Lightroom to read.\
\
The app will leverage the local LLM using Ollama, but will need to be able to reach out to google via my api key if the local LLM can not get image identified correctly (within 95% correct)\
\
\
The will need to figure out which images are of the same item.  The base photo image will be a .CR2 or .CR3 canon image and derivative of the original image will have a different extension or additional elements in the file name.  As an example this is the base image \'93_MG_9194.CR2\'94, the following are all derivatives of the same image, _MG_9194-adj.tif, _MG_9194-adj-Edit-Edit.tif, _MG_9194-adj-Edit-Edit-2.tif,  the app will only use the original base image to do the analysis.  The image will been to be turned into a jpg to be submitted to the LLM.\
\
The app will also need to us what ever image library to find similar images, I have a lot of images of the same item, but taken from a slightly different angle and the app should be able to know they are the same image and only use a single image of the content for analysis by the LLM, I shoot bracketed a lot so there are typically 3 to 5 exact images just different shutter speeds.\
\
I need a good instruction and any additional MD documents to include to help Claude be effective with the project}
