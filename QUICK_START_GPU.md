# 🚀 Quick Start: GPU Acceleration

Get **3-6x faster** image processing in under 5 minutes!

---

## ⚡ One-Command Setup (Recommended)

```bash
npm run optimize
```

**That's it!** This command will:
1. ✅ Install PyTorch with Apple Silicon GPU support
2. ✅ Install all Python dependencies  
3. ✅ Rebuild native modules for ARM64
4. ✅ Verify GPU is working

**Expected time**: 3-5 minutes (downloads ~600MB on first run)

---

## ✅ Verify It Worked

Look for these messages in the terminal:

```
🚀 SUCCESS! Apple Silicon GPU acceleration is ENABLED!
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED - GPU READY!
```

If you see these, you're done! GPU acceleration is enabled.

---

## 🎯 Start the App

```bash
npm start
```

Look for:
```
🚀 Apple Silicon GPU (MPS) is ENABLED!
🚀 Using Apple Silicon GPU (MPS) for CLIP embeddings
```

## 🐛 If Something Went Wrong

### Issue: GPU not detected

**Solution 1** - Reinstall:
```bash
npm run clean
npm run optimize
```

**Solution 2** - Manual setup:
```bash
# Step by step
npm run setup-python
npm run verify-gpu
npm run rebuild-native
npm start
```

### Issue: Python errors

**Solution** - Check your Python:
```bash
# Should be 3.8 or higher
python3 --version

# Should output "arm64" (not x86_64)
python3 -c "import platform; print(platform.machine())"
```

If Python shows x86_64, it's running under Rosetta. Install native ARM64 Python:
```bash
brew install python@3.11
```

## 📊 Check Performance

Before GPU optimization, CLIP takes **2-3 seconds** per image.

After GPU optimization, CLIP takes **0.5-1 second** per image.

That's **3-6x faster**!

- **Full guide**: `APPLE_SILICON_OPTIMIZATION.md`
- **Detailed verification**: `npm run verify-gpu`
- **Test CLIP service**: `npm run test-clip`

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First launch takes longer** - CLIP model downloads (~600MB) only once
2. **Keep your Mac plugged in** - GPU uses more power
3. **Check GPU usage** - Open Activity Monitor > GPU tab
4. **Temperature is normal** - GPU will warm up during processing

**✅ Ready to process thousands of images at maximum speed!**
